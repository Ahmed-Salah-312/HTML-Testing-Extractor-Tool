# HTML-Testing-Extractor-Tool
Developed a comprehensive tool using PyQt5 for the GUI and Selenium for web scraping to extract and process data from HTML files. This tool efficiently extracts test data from HTML tables, processes it, and outputs the results into a well-structured Excel file. Implemented threading to ensure a responsive user interface during data extraction.
