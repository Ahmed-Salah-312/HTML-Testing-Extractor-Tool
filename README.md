# HTML Testing Extractor Tool

## Description
Developed a comprehensive tool using PyQt5 for the GUI and Selenium for web scraping to extract and process data from HTML files. This tool efficiently extracts test data from HTML tables, processes it, and outputs the results into a well-structured Excel file. Implemented threading to ensure a responsive user interface during data extraction. Additionally, created an executable (.exe) file for easy distribution and usage.

## Key Features
- **Select individual HTML files or entire folders containing HTML files.**
- **Progress bar to track the extraction process.**
- **Status updates for each file processed.**
- **Error handling for file selection and extraction issues.**
- **Outputs data into an Excel file with formatted results.**
- **Uses Selenium for reliable data extraction and OpenPyXL for Excel file creation.**
- **Provides an executable file for easy installation and use.**

## Technologies Used
- PyQt5
- Selenium
- OpenPyXL
- Python
- Threading
- PyInstaller

## Responsibilities
- **Designed and implemented the user interface using PyQt5.**
- **Developed the backend logic to handle file and folder selection, data extraction, and Excel file generation.**
- **Utilized Selenium for headless web scraping to retrieve data from HTML tables.**
- **Incorporated threading to maintain UI responsiveness during data processing.**
- **Implemented robust error handling and user prompts to enhance usability.**
- **Created an executable file using PyInstaller for easy distribution.**

## Features

- **Select Files and Folders**: Users can choose to select individual HTML files or entire folders containing HTML files for data extraction.
- **Progress Tracking**: A progress bar tracks the extraction process, providing visual feedback on the current progress.
- **Status Updates**: The application provides real-time status updates for each file processed, including any errors encountered.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures that users are notified of any issues with file selection or data extraction.
- **Excel Output**: Extracted data is saved into a well-structured Excel file with formatted results, including overall test results.
- **Executable File**: An executable (.exe) file is provided for easy installation and usage.

## Technologies Used
